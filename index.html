        <p>The principles of proximity is exemplified in the way that Zumies has grouped together the different genders and types of cloths to make searching faster and more efficient. It would be a mess if the guys and girls cloths were all mixed together. They have also put groups of certain deals, brands, and types of cloths. This way they are able to group things together to help catch peopleâ€™s attention and help the experience be more user friendly.
