            <h1>EcoSmart Logo</h1>
            <p>I have had many opportunities to create logos for many different companies such as apartment management companies, pest control companies, and clothing lines. I have also designed for advertising purposes for a city wide play in Idaho Falls Id. To date, the most successful logo I have created was for a pest control company calles EcoSmart. This is already a multi millions dollar company and my logo is seen on everything form service trucks to contracts and other paperwork. Seeing my logos help a business reach it's potential is always so fulfilling. I have also found great success with the company Rexburg Co. which is a clothing company on the campus of Brigham Young University Idaho. This logo can be seen on clothing of students all across campus. </p>
