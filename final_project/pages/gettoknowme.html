                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p>Hello! My name is Payton, web designer and developer. Although I consider myself a huge asset in both of these fields, there is so much more about me for you to get to know. I come from an Idaho family of 6. This family has just started to grow with the addition of my Sister in law Maddy and my soon-to-be wife Leslie. We get married onDecember 29th. Just a few weeks away! I enjoy everything creative and adventurous. In the images above you see just one of my many adventures that I have taken with friends and family. I have always loved sports and movies and everything creative and exciting. This is what makes me who I am. </p>

                <h1>My Style</h1>
                <p>I have always had a fasination with art and design. This talent and hobby has taken me farther than I ever thought that it would. I now have a degree in graphic design with an emphasis in typography. This major has benefited me greatly in the field of logo design. I have designed logos for several companies including one milti-million dollar company Ecosmart. </p>
