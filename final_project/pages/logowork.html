            <h1>My Logos</h1>
            <p>I have always had a fasination with art and design. This talent and hobby has taken me farther than I ever thought that it would. I now have a degree in graphic design with an emphasis in typography. This major has benefited me greatly in the field of logo design. My goal and purpose in designing these logos is to help companies and individuals create a brand for themselves. This brand should explain perfectly the idea and purpose of their company or dream. I hope to help everyone take their dreams and make them a reality through successful branding and design. </p>

            <h1>EcoSmart Logo</h1>
            <p>I have had many opportunities to create logos for many different companies such as apartment management companies, pest control companies, and clothing lines. I have also designed for advertising purposes for a city wide play in Idaho Falls Id. To date, the most successful logo I have created was for a pest control company calles EcoSmart. This is already a multi millions dollar company and my logo is seen on everything form service trucks to contracts and other paperwork. Seeing my logos help a business reach it's potential is always so fulfilling. I have also found great success with the company Rexburg Co. which is a clothing company on the campus of Brigham Young University Idaho. This logo can be seen on clothing of students all across campus. </p>
